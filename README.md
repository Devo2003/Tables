# Tables

Array:
  So an array simply just takes in a collection of different types. Arrays should be used when dealing with rows and columns of data and when you try to store items with an already know length since its hard to add and remove data from it and also costs memory. This is when lists become more helpful for making changes to the collection after its been made.  
  
HashTable:
  A hashtable is a collection that stores a key and a value pair. The key is used to get the storage location. From what I learned is that Hashtables are used when you want to access the elements by using key and a value with it. 

Stack:
  A stack is a special generic collection class that stores elements and uses the LIFO rule (Last In First Out). From what I understand is that stacks are only used for temporary data so you can erase an element once youâ€™ve gotten its value.

Queue
 Similar to as stack its a special collection type that stores it elements with the FIFO rule (First In First Out). From what I learned is that queue seemed to be faster and its also for temporary data use that you want to process in a specific order that they are made and added.
